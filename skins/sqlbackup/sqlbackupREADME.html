<h2 id="sqlbackup-readme">SQLBackup README</h2>
<p>This skin (<a href="https://github.com/glennmckechnie/weewx-sqlbackup">sqlbackup</a>) uses a Search List Extension (SLE) of the same name to call mysqldump and/or sqlite to dump data from the weeWX database.<br /> If it's MySQL (MariaDB) then it will dump a user specified timeframe; if it's sqlite then it will dump all of it. The suggested option for both cases is to only dump the archive tables.<br />It will do this at regular intervals as specified by the <a href="http://www.weewx.com/docs/customizing.htm#customizing_gen_time">report_timing</a> feature of weeWX.</p>
<p>If you dump the whole database, and it's large, you can interfere with weeWX's operation and odd things may start to happen. This will depend on your CPU, database size, weeWX setup, maybe even the weather!<br />
In most cases this probably won't matter too much and you'll just get a message about skipping reports. If we lock weeWX out of its database for too long though, the weird and wonderful may start to occur, so it's best we don't push it too far.
</p>
<p>This skin was originally configured for MySQL (MariaDB) databases only and we can configure mysqldump to do a partial dump. We can therefore limit ourselves to a small, very managable portion of the database.<br />
Because this has since expanded to incorporate sqlite databases, where it captures the whole database, it may be slower and more prone to interfering with weeWX. But compared to MySQL, sqlite is not as demanding so it may still be fit for duty.<br />Because we are getting a full backup of the sqlite database on each run, we can perhaps do them less frequently and here the report_timing feature really comes into its own.<br />Sqlite databases can also be backed up by simply copying them, if you want a similar 'skinned' approach that does just that then have a look at <a href="https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki/Using-the-RSYNC-skin-as-a-backup-solution">Using the RSYNC skin as a backup solution.</a><br />Both these methods aim to create a backup during a quiet window of time (when there are no database writes) and that's available within the weeWX cycle.</p>
<p>With the variation in weeWX setups, the only way to know how it will work for you is to give it a try. Just start off gently and DON'T ask for too much at once, be conservative with what you're asking for.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2><a href="#Top">Back to top</a>
<ol>
<li>Run the installer:
<pre>wee_extension --install weewx-sqlbackup-master.zip</pre>
<li>Edit the sqlbackup/skin.conf file to suit your installation

 <ul>
  <li>Select a suitable <em>report_timing</em> stanza</li>
  <li>Select a suitable archive period and name (sql_period and sql_label.)</li>
  <li>Check that the defaults are correct for your setup</li>
  <li>In particular, check the backup directory (xxsql_bup_dir) paths. They will be created on the first run.</li>
  <li>The default is to generate reports - sqlbackup.html</li>
  <li>The templates are intended for the newskin branch of weeWX - Seasons. The *.html.tmpl will need tweaking to suit others. (This area does needs refining.)</li>
 </ul>
 <br />
<li>Restart weewx:
<pre>sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop</pre>
<pre>sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start</pre>
</ol>
<p>The html template makes heavy use of #include files to generate the report page. These files are located in /tmp/sqlbackup and will remain after each run (if you need to inspect them or see what's happening). They will be blanked, deleted, re-generated on each run of the skin. ie: they are all renewed and should reflect each runs output. There are no stale files, they are unique to each run - thus their placement in the /tmp directory.</p>

<h2 id="notes-for-mysql-mariadb-database">Notes for MySQL (MariaDB) database</h2><a href="#Top">Back to top</a>
<p>If your database is a MySQL one then to use this backup method effectively, you need to do a full dump (backup) of your main weeWX database first. Of note; while dumping the database may take seconds, stretching to minutes, rebuilding it can take hours. The best advice I can offer is to rebuild it as a working copy ASAP. You will then bring that up-todate with the partial dumps. Whatever you do - test your restore strategy well before time.<br />
<p>A strategy I've used is to have a working, preferably empty, sqlite database ready to go. If you need to rebuild your MySQL database you can simply reconfigure weewx to use archive_sqlite while the MySQL is restored. Once the MySQL is restored, swap weewx back to archive_mysql. Dump the sqlite into an sql file, convert and import it into your restored and working MySQL (reference the notes on the wiki - <a href="http://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki/Transfer%20from%20sqlite%20to%20MySQL">Transfer from sqlite to MySQL</a>) and you'll fill the gaps nicely - well, most of them.</p>
<p>Whatever you choose to do, we need a starting point.<br />
To get that initial database, you can do this manually by invoking mysqldump from the command line, similar to the following.</p>
<h3 id="method-1">Full dump: Method 1</h3><a href="#Top">Back to top</a>
<p>Get the epoch date string to use in the filename (optional but helpful later.)</p>
<pre><code>date +%s
1497830683</code></pre>
<p>dump the data into a suitable file(name)</p>
<pre><code>mysqldump -uweewx -p -hlocalhost weatherpi archive --single-transaction --skip-opt |
        gzip &gt; /{your_backup_directory}/wholebackup-1497830683.sql</code></pre>
<p>Adding the epoch date string to the filename helps in determing its current age, ie:- when to do update from. You'll then use the partial backups created by this skin, to restore from that date.</p>
<h3 id="method-2">Full dump: Method 2</h3><a href="#Top">Back to top</a>
<p> Or if you want to live dangerously and see just how long it does take to generate a whole backup with this skin, and see if my warnings are overstated, then configure the skin.conf for that single run.<br />
Picking a timestamp that precedes your database starting point should do it. Unless you have over 2 years of data the following should work - adjust accordingly.</p>

<pre>
60*60*24*365*2
= 63072000
</pre>
<p>Plug that value in as your time period - sql_period = "63072000" and change the file label to something meaningful - sql_label = "allofit" so that <b>you</b> can see at a glance what it is.</p>

</pre>
<p>The above shows one hiccup for my single run - it took 90 seconds which exceeds the 60 second archive interval, therefore weeWX skipped the reports for that time interval. After that it's back to normal, which is OK by me.</p>
<p>And FWIW, opening the resulting file and finding the first dateTime entry shows I over estimated at 2 years.</p>
<pre>
date -d +@1451720100
Sat  2 Jan 18:35:00 AEDT 2016
</pre>
<p>Looks like that's all I've got in there. Yep! It seems I'll have to find and restore a few earlier databases.</p>

<p>Another aside, it took 7 hours on a quad-core AMD A8-5600K to re-instate that database (1 minute weewx archive_interval). There's something to be said for doing this on a (semi-)regular basis, and with small dump files.</p>

<h3><a id="configuring-partial-dump">Configuring: skin.conf</a></h3><a href="#Top">Back to top</a>

<p>The skin.conf file may appear overwhelming but it should run with the values that are pre-configured.
If not wade through it and find what needs tweaking.

It's well commented :-)</p>

<p>When configuring sqlbackup, DO turn on sql_debug in the skin.conf file.<br /> Set it to at least 2 for system logging (/var/log/syslog). If you're generating the html report then set it to 4 and you'll find the debug output at the bottom of the sqlbackup.html page.<br /> Pay particular attention to the times returned in the DEBUG lines. Make sure they are sane. (Remember the warnings above?)</p>
<p>The partial dumps created by this skin have a header, which includes the CREATE TABLE statement - a lot of INSERT statements and a footer.</p>

<p>Any of these files will re-populate a database by themselves.<br />To attempt the same process immediately with another file will create an error as they each have a <b>CREATE TABLE</b> statement.<br />
So these files are one-shot only - unless we modify them.</p>
<p>To add data from another of these files, we (you) need to do some editing.</p>
<h3 id="to-restore-using-more-than-one-file...">To restore using more than one file...</h3><a href="#Top">Back to top</a>
<p>The following is a simplified walk through of the process.<br />
We need:-</p>
<ul>
<li>one only header</li>
<li>As many <em>INSERT INTO</em> statements as are required for the database update.</li>
<li>one only footer</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if we were to do the following, we'd have success.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /tmp/restore
cd /tmp/restore
cp our_partial_backups to_here
gunzip *</code></pre>
<p>That's the groundwork, we are now ready to start.<br />
<ul>
 <li>Create some duplicate files</li>
 <li>Edit these <em>header</em> and <em>footer</em> files to contain only those fields (we don't want any INSERT INTO instructions)
 <ul>
  <li>header = everything above the first INSERT INTO statement (recap? see above)</li>
  <li>footer = everything below the last INSERT INTO statement (recap? see above)</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<pre><code>cp weatherpi-host.masterofpis-201706150020-24hours header
cp weatherpi-host.masterofpis-201706150020-24hours footer</code></pre>
<p>We now need our data. We duplicate the required files and edit the result.</p>
<ul>
 <li>With these, we only want the <strong>INSERT INTO</strong> instructions. That's all the middle data, the bulk of the file.</li>
 <li>We delete the header and footers within these files.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>cp weatherpi-host.masterofpis-201706150020-24hours 1
cp weatherpi-host.masterofpis-201706151033-24hours 1a
cp weatherpi-host.masterofpis-201706170020-24hours-middle 2
cp weatherpi-host.masterofpis-201706190021-daily 3</code></pre>
<p>Using these modified files we use <strong>sort</strong> to remove duplicate lines and create one compact file that contains all the INSERT statements for the time period that we want.</p>
<pre><code>
sort -u 1 1a 2 3 &gt; tempins
# the order really does not matter, sort will do what it says and the -u flag will get rid of the dupes.</code></pre>

<p>We now create a new file with a header, all the INSERT's we require, plus the footer.<br />
We're back to the start, but bigger and better!</p>
<pre><code>cat header  &gt; new_file.sql
cat tempins &gt;&gt; new_file.sql
cat footer &gt;&gt; new_file.sql</code></pre>
<p>Create the database</p>
<pre><code>mysql -u root -p
create database dumpnewtest;
quit;</code></pre>
<p>Redirect our new file into mysql and we will have a database consisting of that data.</p>
<pre><code>mysql -u root -p dumptestnew &lt; new_file.sql</code></pre>
<p>And if you want to, dump that and compare it to what we restored from the new_file. They should be the same, where it really matters!</p>
<pre><code>mysqldump -u root -p -q --single-transaction --skip-opt dumptestnew &gt; dumptestnew-compare.sql
vim -d new_file.sql dumptestnew-compare.sql</code></pre>
<p>That's an outline of the process. Names have obviously been changed to suit. Tweak to suit.</p>
<h4 id="psuedo-script">A psuedo script</h4><a href="#Top">Back to top</a>
<p>The following is a psuedo bash script - it will work as is (after changing names!) but you'll need to be familiar with vim and the process as outlined above, re: headers and footers</p>
<pre><code>

<p>The process to dump an sqlite database goes a lot faster than the mysqldump process. This doesn't mean that you can ignore the warnings outlined above. It will still take time and you won't know how it long that will be until you've tried it out.  If it does fail badly then try another method, such as the one using Rsync outlined on the weeWX wiki (see the link given at the start).</p>
<p>Same method applies as above when you are configuring sqlbackup, DO turn on sql_debug in the skin.conf file.
Set it to at least 2 for system logging (/var/log/syslog). If you're generating the html report then set it to 4 and you'll find the debug output at the bottom of the sqlbackup.html page.
Pay particular attention to the times returned in the DEBUG lines. Make sure they are sane. (Remember the warnings above?)</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-the-report-pages">Setting up the report pages</a></h2><a href="#Top">Back to top</a>
<p>The report page is optional but recommended. At the very least generate and use it while setting up the skin. It's intended to give a quick overview of what happened during each run.<br />
An extract of the .sql capture is displayed, the command syntax used, and any errors that occured with that system command. The sql extract shows the start and finish of the file so you have an idea of what the file contains and therefore what the command generated. If the dump failed late in the capture, it will often show something to that affect at the end of the file. The mysql extract shows the first 100 lines and last 20. The sqlite shows the first 20 and the last 20.</p>
<p>The report was written with the Seasons skin in mind (ie: the newskin branch at github/weewx) and uses the seasons.css file. It can be adapted to suit any other skin by simply including the &#35;includes as noted within sqlbackup.html.tmpl.</p>
<p>The sqlbackup/sqlbackupREADME.html is a html version of the github README.md and is included to give some background and an example / outline of what to do with the resulting files. It's not meant to be a one stop HowTo. You'll need to do some further reading and perform a few practice "restores", well before the time comes that you'll actually need to.</p>
<p>The file <i>sqlbackup.inc</i> is an &#35;include for use with the seasons/index.html.tmpl file. It's not the cleanest implementation as /tmp/sqlbackup/head.inc doesn't exist until sqlbackup has run at least once. This results in the seasons skin aborting until it is generated. (You'll get a python exception logged, regarding the /tmp/sqlbackup/head.inc missing) A plain link is probably better if that bothers you, or no link if your memory and typing skills are up to it.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-skins">Multiple databases, multiple skins</a></h2><a href="#Top">Back to top</a>
<p>The default setup of this skin is to backup the main weewx database. It should do that 'out of the box'.<br />If you modify the database stanzas it will ignore the default behaviour and do what you ask. A space seperated list will allow you to do each of those databases. If you specify mysql_database and sql_database it will bow down and do those too, what ever you say goes. If it doesn't get up again you may want to rethink that strategy!<br /> Maybe you just want the timing of those backups to be different? If so consider using multiple skins.</p>

<p>This skin can be duplicated if you want to split the backups.<br /> You may want to do this if you have multiple databases and don't want the performance hit of doing them all at once. It may also be because you want to treat them differently. Your main weewx database has a 48 hour snapshot taken daily, then a monthly snapshot taken... monthly? if only because you hate the idea of stitching all the smaller ones together again. Your mesoraw weekly, at some other time, for some other reason, etc.<p />
You'll need to do this skin duplication process, manually.
<pre>
   cd skins
   cp -r sqlbackup sqlbackupweek
</pre>
Open the weewx/weewx.conf file and duplicate the sqlbackup entry there, and change as required.

<pre>

[StdReport]
[...]
    #original entry
    [[sqlbackup]]
       HTML_ROOT = /var/www/html/weewx/sqlbackup
       skin = sqlbackup
    # 2nd skin
    [[sqlbackupweek]]
       HTML_ROOT = /var/www/html/weewx/sqlbackupweek
       skin = sqlbackupweek
</pre>

Open the new directory, skin/sqlbackupweek and edit the skin.conf within. Change the report_timing stanza and the section heading

<pre>

# Report timing: http://www.weewx.com/docs/customizing.htm#customizing_gen_time
#
# 2 minutes past midnight, on Monday. 2 minutes past the hour may prevent a possible clash with  @daily or @weekly.
# Monday ensures it.
report_timing = '2 * * * 1'

#[...]

#[sqlbackup] # This section heading is all lower case to enable skin duplication.
[sqlbackupweek] # This section heading is all lower case to enable skin duplication.

        #sql_user = "your_user_if_different_to_weewx.conf"
</pre>

That's it. You should be good to go. Tread lightly.
