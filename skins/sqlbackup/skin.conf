#   This 'report' generates gzipped backup files from a running weewx         #
#  database. It doesn't generate any pages at the moment, however generating  #
#  a report on it's success or otherwise would be useful. One day...          #
#                                                                             #

# Report timing - see http://www.weewx.com/docs/customizing.htm#customizing_gen_time

#  4 min after, every 6 hours
#report_timing  = '4 */6 * * *'
#   20 min after, every hour
report_timing = '56 */1 * * *'
#report_timing = '@daily'

# Notes and WARNINGS
#
# DON'T back the whole database up with this skin. You'll overload weewx and weird
# things will happen.
#
# The idea is to instead select a small rolling window from the database, and dump
# this at each report_timing interval. We will use that as a partial backup.
# At restore time we'll then need to select some or all, and stitch them together as
# appropriate.
#
# This skin was created to backup a weewx database that runs purely in memory. Because
# that's a little! fragile, the script runs every hour, and dumps the last 24 hours
# of the database to the sql_bup_file in the format...
#      {database}-host.{hostname}-{epoch-timestamp}-{window-time-period}.gz
# eg:  weatherpi-host.masterofpis-201706132105-24hours.gz
#
# Those intervals are handled easily on my setup and do not interrupt the report
# generation in weewx.
#
# Jun 13 21:05:42 masterofpis wee_reports[26062]: sqlbackup: Created backup in 0.31 seconds
#
# You'll need to adjust the values to suit your setup. Set sql_debug = "2" while you
# do so. This script currently performs no error checking so check the resulting files
# for integrity.
# disk full; will return silence
# empty database dump; will return silence
#
# Reasons for doing backups this way (instead of seperate scripts and cron) are that it
# should integrate easily with the weewx process. Keep it small and sensible and
# that should remain true.
